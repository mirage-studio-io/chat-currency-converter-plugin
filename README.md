## Plugin development

```bash
[plugin-repo]
|- main.py
|- manifest.json
|- openapi.yaml
|- logo.png
`- ... # other
```

### manifest.json

[plugin-manifest](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/plugin-manifest): Every plugin requires a ai-plugin.json file, which needs to be hosted on the APIâ€™s domain.

### openapi.yaml

[openapi-definition](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/openapi-definition): OpenAPI specification to document the API. The model in ChatGPT does not know anything about your API other than what is defined in the OpenAPI specification and manifest file. This means that if you have an extensive API, you need not expose all functionality to the model and can choose specific endpoints.
